Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi BikeLinks to an external site program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers. 

I am focusing on the CitiBike data from the New Jersey area, Jersey City and Hoboken, just west of Manhattan. which has 82 stations and riders have access to over 27,000 bikes(including those in NYC).
The CitBike NJ Trip History Data is publicly available and I read the csv files for each month of 2023 into a Jupyter Notebook in order to clean and concatenate the data before performing analysis using Tableau.

I wanted to answer the following questions:

* Which stations are the busiest for starting and ending rides?
  
* What days of the week are busiest?

* What time of day are CitiBikes most frequently used?

* What are the differences in the riding behavior of CitiBike 'members' -  who pay an annual or monthly fee and have unlimited use of the bikes for 45 minutes at a time and the 'casual' members who don't have a subscription,pay to unlock the bicycles each time and then pay by the minute.

* Which variety of bike, electric or classic, do these member types prefer?

These visualizations will be used to design a dashboard for each phenomenon accompanied by an analysis explaining why the phenomenon may be occurring.

A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey, with zip code data overlaid on top will be created.

The audience for this presentation will be city officials, public administrators, and heads of New York City municipal departments. The analysis will be presented in a way that is focused, concise, easy to understand, and visually compelling. Visualizations will be colorful enough to be included in press releases, and thoughtful enough to inform programmatic changes.
